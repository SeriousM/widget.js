What is a 'widget'?

A widget is something that produces html.


How does a widget produces its html?

The creator of the widget must provide a 'producer function' that is responsible for emitting the html of the widget.


Where does a widget puts its html to?

The widget appends/inserts its html into a container DOM element as well as passes the html over to the 'done' callback(s).
